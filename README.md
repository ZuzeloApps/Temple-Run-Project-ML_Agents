In this project 2 Machine Learning Agents were trained to run from a dragon in a never ending dungeon. At the end of each room one of 3 traps is generated. Besides learning how to run, they also learned how to better avoid those obstacles aswell as how to intercat with each-other to achieve higher goals.

Main action takes place in Dungeon Generator Script. 
SmartGuy Script - Tulio's Behaviour
